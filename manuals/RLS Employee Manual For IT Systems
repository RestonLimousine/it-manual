First Steps

If you have just been hired, here is what to expect in your first few days:

# *PC & Workstation:* Your manager will show you to the area where you will work. Some employees get an assigned workstation, while others share a workstation with other employees.
# *Network Credentials:* IT will create a network account for you, and your manager will provide you the credentials you will use to log into your PC. These are the same credentials you will use for email and other services.
# *Phone Extension:* If you were assigned a dedicated workstation with a desk phone, IT will register your extension to you.

Here is what you will need to do:

# *Log into PC:* Use your new network credentials to log into your PC.
# *Sign into email:* Once logged into the PC, open up Outlook.
  - Click on the search bar next to the Start menu that says "Type here to search", then search for Outlook.
  - The first time you open Outlook, it will ask you to enter your network credentials again. Choose to save them so you don't have to enter them again in the future.
  - It's a good idea to right-click on the icon on your taskbar (bottom of the screen), then choose "pin to taskbar" so that Outlook can always be easily accessed from the taskbar.
  - Send yourself an email to see your email signature. Double-check the info in your signature to make sure it's correct.
# *Find other applications:* You should also find other applications that you might use frequently and pin them to the taskbar. Common applications include:
  # Excel
  # File Explorer
  # FileMaker Pro
  # Google Chrome
  # Word
  # Powerpoint
  # Calculator
  # Snip & Sketch (for screenshots)
If you find that you don't use some of these applications very often, you can always unpin them from the taskbar later.
# *Set up voicemail:* If you have a desk phone, make sure your it shows your name, then set up your voicemail.
  # Dial 400
  # When prompted, enter password 0000
  # Press 3 for personal options
  # Press 3 for name
  # Press 2 to record your name, then record

If you need any help with any of this, reach out to your manager or IT.



Share Drive

The Share drive is where most RLS documents are found.  It should be accessible from any office PC and the terminal server (more on that at [link: #to-do]).

To access the Share drive, open File Explorer (search for it in the search bar, open it, then pin the icon to the taskbar).  On the lefthand side of the window, under "This PC", you should see "share (\\rls-app) (S:)".  Click on it, and you will see a listing of folders and files on the right.

The vast majority of documents that you will need are found in the folder *RLS Operations*.  Double click on that folder, and you will see the following, among other things:

# *Contract Information*: Contains all the files pertaining to shuttle contracts.
# *Departments*: Contains department-level information. Mostly for use by managers.
# *Forms - Accounting*: Contains useful accounting-related documents, including the expense reimbursement form.
# *Forms - HR*: Contains useful HR documents, including the employee handbook and TEAM tracker form.
# *Forms - Payroll*: Contains many useful payroll-related documents, including the annual payroll schedule and the leave request form.

*NOTE*: Be careful what you do in the Share drive!  Do not edit, delete or move documents or folders that do not belong to you.  If you are unsure, ask your manager!
