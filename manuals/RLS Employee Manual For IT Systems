First Steps

If you have just been hired, here is what to expect in your first few days:

# *PC & Workstation:* Your manager will show you to the area where you will work. Some employees get an assigned workstation, while others share a workstation with other employees.
# *Network Credentials:* IT will create a network account for you, and your manager will provide you the credentials you will use to log into your PC. These are the same credentials you will use for email and other services.
# *Phone Extension:* If you were assigned a dedicated workstation with a desk phone, IT will register your phone extension to you.

Here is what you will need to do:

# *Log into PC:* Use your new network credentials to log into your PC.
# *Sign into email:* Once logged into the PC, open up Outlook.
  - Click on the search bar next to the Start menu that says "Type here to search", then search for Outlook.
  - The first time you open Outlook, it will ask you to enter your network credentials again. Choose to save them so you don't have to enter them again in the future.
  - It's a good idea to right-click on the icon on your taskbar (bottom of the screen), then choose "pin to taskbar" so that Outlook can always be easily accessed from the taskbar.
  - Send yourself an email to see your email signature. Double-check the info in your signature to make sure it's correct.
# *Find other applications:* You should also find other applications that you might use frequently and pin them to the taskbar. Common applications include:
  # Excel
  # File Explorer
  # FileMaker Pro
  # Google Chrome
  # Word
  # Powerpoint
  # Calculator
  # Snip & Sketch (for screenshots)
  If you find that you don't use some of these applications very often, you can always unpin them from the taskbar later.
# *Set up voicemail:* If you have a desk phone, make sure your it shows your name, then set up your voicemail.
  # Dial *400*
  # When prompted, enter password *0000*
  # Press *3* for personal options
  # Press *3* for name
  # Press *2* to record your name, then record

If you need any help with any of this, reach out to your manager or IT.



Hardware

Every workstation has a PC, keyboard, mouse and at least one monitor. Some have two monitors, and others might have computer speakers or a printer.  If you have any issues with this hardware, you want replacements, or you want to add something, check with the IT department. We often have spare equipment and accessories in storage, and if not, then we can order tested-and-approved products, often at a discounted rate. Please do not order your own equipment, as this will make it difficult for us to troubleshoot issues and reuse hardware as distribution needs change.



Share Drive

The Share drive is where most RLS documents are found.  It should be accessible from any office PC and the terminal server (more on that at [link: #to-do]).

To access the Share drive, open File Explorer (search for it in the search bar, open it, then pin the icon to the taskbar).  On the lefthand side of the window, under "This PC", you should see "share (\\rls-app) (S:)".  Click on it, and you will see a listing of folders and files on the right.

The vast majority of documents that you will need are found in the folder *RLS Operations*.  Double click on that folder, and you will see the following folders, among many others:

# *Contract Information*: Contains all the files pertaining to shuttle contracts.
# *Departments*: Contains department-level information. Mostly for use by managers.
# *Forms - Accounting*: Contains useful accounting-related documents, including the expense reimbursement form.
# *Forms - HR*: Contains useful HR documents, including the employee handbook and TEAM tracker form.
# *Forms - Payroll*: Contains many useful payroll-related documents, including the annual payroll schedule and the leave request form.

*NOTE*: Be *very* careful what you do in the Share drive!  Do not edit, delete or move documents or folders that do not belong to you.  If you are unsure, ask your manager!

Whenever you open a file on the Share drive, you prevent other users from being able to edit the file. Please be courteous to others and only keep files open for as long as you need to edit them. If someone else is editing a file when you try to open it, a pop-up window will give you the option to open the file in read-only mode. This is fine if all you needed was to read the file, but if you needed to make changes, then you will have to wait for the other user to finish editing. Feel free to send them an email asking them to inform you when they are done with the file. In emergencies, you can open the file in read-only mode, make changes, and save a copy of the file to your U drive (see [link: #to-do]), but be advised that these changes will not be in the original file. Do not save copies of files on the Share drive, because this leads to confusion about which file is the most recent one.

Most users should not create new files or folders on the Share drive. Ask your manager first.  You can always create new files on your U drive (see below), email them to your manager to approval, then move them to the Share drive when approved.



U Drive

In File Explorer, on the lefthand side underneath the Share drive you will see a drive with your username, something like *jswetnam (\\rls-app\users) (U:)*.  This is called your "U drive", and it is where you can put documents that are for your own use, which you don't intend or aren't ready to share with others.

Whenever you have a file that you don't want to put on the Share drive, it is best practice to put it in your U drive, not on your PC. The following are examples of locations on your PC where you should *not* save files:

# Desktop
# Documents folder
# Downloads folder (okay for temporary downloads, but move the file to your U drive if you want to use it later)
# Pictures and Videos folder
# Anywhere on the C: drive

It is preferrable to use your U drive, rather than the above locations, for the following reasons:

# Save space on your PC. PCs have limited hard-drive space, and files on the Share and U drives *do not* take up space on your PC.
# Files on the Share and U drives are backed up regularly, so if anything happens, we can retrieve a recent backup.
# Files on the Share and U drives are accessible on other PCs and through the terminal server (more at [link: #to-do]). If you ever switch PCs or work on the terminal server, you will not have access to the files on your PC, but you will have access to those on the Share and U drives.
