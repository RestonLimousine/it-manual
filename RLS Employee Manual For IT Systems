First Steps

If you have just been hired, here is what to expect in your first few days:

# *PC & Workstation:* Your manager will show you to the area where you will work.
# *Network Credentials:* IT will create a network account for you, and your manager will provide you the credentials you will use to log into your PC the first time.
# *Phone Extension:* If your workstation includes a desk phone, IT will register your extension.

Here is what you need to do after the above:

# *Log Into PC:* Use your new network credentials to log into your PC. Open up Outlook -- the first time, you may need to enter your network credentials again, but you can choose to save them so you don't have to enter them in the future.
