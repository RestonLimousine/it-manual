First Steps

If you have just been hired, here is what to expect in your first few days:

# *PC & Workstation:* Your manager will show you to the area where you will work. Some employees get an assigned workstation, while others share a workstation with other employees.
# *Network Credentials:* IT will create a network account for you, and your manager will provide you the credentials you will use to log into your PC. These are the same credentials you will use for email and other services.
# *Phone Extension:* If you were assigned a dedicated workstation with a desk phone, IT will register your extension to you.

Here is what you will do:

# *Log into PC:* Use your new network credentials to log into your PC.
# *Sign into email:* Open up Outlook -- the first time, you may need to enter your network credentials again, but you can choose to save them so you don't have to enter them in the future.
